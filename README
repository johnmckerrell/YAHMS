This arduino code is supposed to give a generic base to build hardware
on and have it controlled by configuration on a web site. The website
will provide "control blocks" specifying when digital outputs should
be turned on and will also specify Analog inputs that should be
sampled and sent back to the server. The server will also specify
pins that are connected to an Xbee module, if these pins are present
and the Arduino receives samples from other Xbee modules then these
will also be sent back to the server.

Though this code is quite functional it should still be considered an
early release. It requires the very latest Ethernet libraries
available from amcewen on github:
    https://github.com/amcewen/Arduino

It also requires the HttpClient and Flash libraries which are
available separately.
